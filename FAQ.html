<h1>Installation</h1>

<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> I tried to install the package, but it fails. What's wrong?
  <dd> Very hard to tell without more information!

  <dt>
  <li> Okay, I'll tell you more about how the package failed to
  install.
       It said something about not finding curl-config and then gave
         a line something like
<pre>
   ERROR: configuration failed for package 'RCurl'
</pre>      
      
  <dd> (Mostly for UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X users)
      So this seems pretty clear. R is telling you that the
  <underline>configuration</underline> for RCurl failed. 
        So you need to think about how it is configured.
         The fact that it couldn't find curl-config should
      suggest the problem.  And what it means is
      that one or more of the following is true
      <ul>
	<li> curl-config is not found in your path
	<li> curl-config and related devlopment libraries (libcurl)
	      are not installed.
      </ul>
   So you need to make certain that libcurl is available.
       Do something like <code>locate libcurl</code> and see
      if it returns something like libcurl.so in the lines it
      emits. Alternatively, do
      <code>locate curl-config</code> and see if it is present.
      <p/>
      If libcurl is not installed, use your binary package manager
      to install the curl-dev package. This is different from
      the curl package which is the command-line tool
      for using curl to download files. We need the "linkable" library.
      
  
  <dt>
  <li> What version of libcurl do I need?
  <dd>
      I use curl-7.12.0. This is sometimes know as libcurl3
      (e.g. in Debian packages).
      Some other versions of libcurl work, but I have only tested
      this with curl-7.11.2  (a.k.a libcurl2)
      You can download the versions from
      <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html">http://curl.haxx.se/download.html</a>.
      
  <dt>
  <li> I get errors about <code>CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH</code>
      not being defined when the C code is being compiled.
      What's the problem?
  <dd>
      The version of libcurl is important. I have developed this
      package using curl-7.12. You should download and install that.
      If this becomes a problem, we can perform tests as to what
      features are available at installation time and customize
      to that.

  <dt> I get errors about such as
<pre>
 url.c: In function `RCurlVersionInfoToR':
 curl.c:613: structure has no member named `libidn'
 curl.c:613: structure has no member named `libidn'
</pre>

      <dd> Again, this is a version of libcurl problem.  We have seen
	  this with curl-7.11.2.  Again, we want curl-7.12!  However,
	  I have added a test for this in the code so that this
	  problem doesn't arise.
	  The libidn field will be NA if there is no such field in the
	  version structure.  If it is present but empty, we return "". </dl>


      <dt>
      <li> I get errors about things not being defined, even basic
	  curl  structures, etc. What's the problem?
      <dd>
	  Possibly, you are not using GNU make.
	  The Makevars file in the src/ directory
	  uses some GNU make constructs.
	  Please set the environment variable
	  MAKE to gmake.
</dl>

<h2>Runtime</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>When I go to a page that is just a directory,
      I get results about "302 Moved Permanently".
      My browser shows the list of files. What's the difference?
  <dd>
      Not entirely certain yet!  But try putting a / at the end of the
      URI, e.g.
      change
<pre>
      http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl
</pre>            
      to
<pre>
      http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl/
</pre>
      That works for me.


  <dt> <li> Why does https not work for me?

  <dd> Probably because when you compiled/installed libcurl, you didn't have support for
  SSL.  You can check this with the command <pre> curl-config
  --feature </pre> If ssl doesn't appear there, you don't have support
  for it.  You should reinstall curl, having first installed SSL
  (e.g. <a href="http://www.openssl.org">openssl</a>).
