  <dt>
  <li> What version of libcurl do I need?
  <dd>
      I use curl-7.12.0. This is sometimes know as libcurl3
      (e.g. in Debian packages).
      Some other versions of libcurl work, but I have only tested
      this with curl-7.11.2  (a.k.a libcurl2)
      You can download the versions from
      <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html">http://curl.haxx.se/download.html</a>.
      
  <dt>
  <li> I get errors about <code>CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH</code>
      not being defined when the C code is being compiled.
      What's the problem?
  <dd>
      The version of libcurl is important. I have developed this
      package using curl-7.12. You should download and install that.
      If this becomes a problem, we can perform tests as to what
      features are available at installation time and customize
      to that.

  <dt> I get errors about such as
<pre>
 url.c: In function `RCurlVersionInfoToR':
 curl.c:613: structure has no member named `libidn'
 curl.c:613: structure has no member named `libidn'
</pre>

      <dd> Again, this is a version of libcurl problem.  We have seen
	  this with curl-7.11.2.  Again, we want curl-7.12!  However,
	  I have added a test for this in the code so that this
	  problem doesn't arise.
	  The libidn field will be NA if there is no such field in the
	  version structure.  If it is present but empty, we return "". </dl>


      <dt>
      <li> I get errors about things not being defined, even basic
	  curl  structures, etc. What's the problem?
      <dd>
	  Possibly, you are not using GNU make.
	  The Makevars file in the src/ directory
	  uses some GNU make constructs.
	  Please set the environment variable
	  MAKE to gmake.
</dl>

<h2>Runtime</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>When I go to a page that is just a directory,
      I get results about "302 Moved Permanently".
      My browser shows the list of files. What's the difference?
  <dd>
      Not entirely certain yet!  But try putting a / at the end of the
      URI, e.g.
      change
<pre>
      http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl
</pre>            
      to
<pre>
      http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl/
</pre>
      That works for me.


  <dt> <li> Why does https not work for me?

  <dd> Probably because when you compiled/installed libcurl, you didn't have support for
  SSL.  You can check this with the command <pre> curl-config
  --feature </pre> If ssl doesn't appear there, you don't have support
  for it.  You should reinstall curl, having first installed SSL
  (e.g. <a href="http://www.openssl.org">openssl</a>).
