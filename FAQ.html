<h1>Installation</h1>

<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> I tried to install the package, but it fails. What's wrong?
  <dd> Very hard to tell without more information!

  <dt>
  <li> Okay, I'll tell you more about how the package failed to
  install.
       It said something about not finding curl-config and then gave
         a line something like
<pre>
   ERROR: configuration failed for package 'RCurl'
</pre>      
      
  <dd> (Mostly for UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X users)
      So this seems pretty clear. R is telling you that the
  <underline>configuration</underline> for RCurl failed. 
        So you need to think about how it is configured.
         The fact that it couldn't find curl-config should
      suggest the problem.  And what it means is
      that one or more of the following is true
      <ul>
	<li> curl-config is not found in your path
	<li> curl-config and related devlopment libraries (libcurl)
	      are not installed.
      </ul>
   So you need to make certain that libcurl is available.
       Do something like <code>locate libcurl</code> and see
      if it returns something like libcurl.so in the lines it
      emits. Alternatively, do
      <code>locate curl-config</code> and see if it is present.
      <p/>
      If libcurl is not installed, use your binary package manager
      to install the curl-dev package. This is different from
      the curl package which is the command-line tool
      for using curl to download files. We need the "linkable" library.
      
  
  <dt>
  <li> What version of libcurl do I need?
  <dd>
      I use curl-7.12.0. This is sometimes know as libcurl3
      (e.g. in Debian packages).
      Some other versions of libcurl work, but I have only tested
      this with curl-7.11.2  (a.k.a libcurl2)
      You can download the versions from
      <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html">http://curl.haxx.se/download.html</a>.
      
  <dt>
  <li> I get errors about <code>CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH</code>
      not being defined when the C code is being compiled.
      What's the problem?
  <dd>
      The version of libcurl is important. I have developed this
      package using curl-7.12. You should download and install that.
      If this becomes a problem, we can perform tests as to what
      features are available at installation time and customize
      to that.

  <dt> I get errors about such as
<pre>
 url.c: In function `RCurlVersionInfoToR':
 curl.c:613: structure has no member named `libidn'
 curl.c:613: structure has no member named `libidn'
</pre>

      <dd> Again, this is a version of libcurl problem.  We have seen
	  this with curl-7.11.2.  Again, we want curl-7.12!  However,
	  I have added a test for this in the code so that this
	  problem doesn't arise.
	  The libidn field will be NA if there is no such field in the
	  version structure.  If it is present but empty, we return "". </dl>


      <dt>
      <li> I get errors about things not being defined, even basic
	  curl  structures, etc. What's the problem?
      <dd>
	  Possibly, you are not using GNU make.
	  The Makevars file in the src/ directory
	  uses some GNU make constructs.
	  Please set the environment variable
	  MAKE to gmake.
</dl>

<h2>Runtime</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>When I go to a page that is just a directory,
      I get results about "302 Moved Permanently".
      My browser shows the list of files. What's the difference?
  <dd>
      Not entirely certain yet!  But try putting a / at the end of the
      URI, e.g.
      change
<pre>
      http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl
</pre>            
      to
<pre>
      http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl/
</pre>
      That works for me.


  <dt> <li> Why does https not work for me?

  <dd> Probably because when you compiled/installed libcurl, you didn't have support for
  SSL.  You can check this with the command <pre> curl-config
  --feature </pre> If ssl doesn't appear there, you don't have support
  for it.  You should reinstall curl, having first installed SSL
  (e.g. <a href="http://www.openssl.org">openssl</a>).


  <dt>
  <li> I'm trying to use RCurl to do something in R that works
      in a Web browser and I can even reproduce using the
      command line program <b>curl</b>.
      (That's a big help as we know we are both using libcurl!)
      But when I do things in R, it fails. What's the problem
      and how can I fix it?
  <dd>
      Well, there are too many potential reasons
      and we would need to have more information about what
      you are attempting to do and what the error messages are.
      But for one, you might look at authentication
      and activating Basic authentication, e.g
      add 
       <code>httpauth = 1L, # "basic"</code>
      to the curl options.
      <p>
       But there is a general approach to trying to figure out how
      to get R to do the same thing as a browser or <b>curl</b>
      or <b>wget</b>.
      One approach is to make certain that both R
      and <b>curl</b> are giving us as much information as possible.
      So make sure both have verbose switched on.
      In R, this is a curl option <code>verbose = TRUE</code>
      and for <b>curl</b>, is is the command line switch -v.
      Then look at the header information both produce and see if
      anything is obviously missing or different in the R version.
      <p>
      A different idea is somewhat advanced, but not very.
      When the browser or <b>curl</b> makes a request,
      it is sent across the network via your operating
      system.
      With the appropriate permissions on the computer,
      we can use a program such as tcpdump or wireshark or ethereal
      to "sniff" or capture the packets as they go across the network
      device and then we can look at them.
       We can do this for the <b>curl</b> or browser
      and then for R and compare what is being sent.
      This allows us to see the headers as we can with the
      verbose options, but it also allows us to see the
      content of the body of the request. This is only important
      for POST requests.
      <p>
      We should also note that if you are using HTTPS, the body will
      be encrypted and you won't be able to make any sense of it.
      However, if the data in the post are not sensitive, you can
      send it via HTTP - not HTTPS - and curl and the Web browser
      will do the same thing and we will be able to see the contents.
      The server will likely be confused and upset and give an error,
      but we are trying  to determine the problem on the initial
      client request so that is not a problem.
      (It is a problem if we are trying to understand why R is not
       handling the response correctly, but that's a different problem.)
      <p>

       How do we use tcpdump and ethereal?
First, start tcpdump just before you run the R or <b>curl</b> command
<pre>
sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -s 1518 -i eth1 -w r_packets.tcp
</pre>
If you do this and wait too long, you will capture all the background
packets that are flying through your network interface that have
nothing to do with your problem. This is not a problem, but it makes
it harder to find the packets which we want to examine.
<p>
So next, go back to R or <b>curl</b> and run the command.
When this has completed, kill the tcpdump process, e.g
Ctrl-C in the terminal in which it is running or kill with the
relevant process id (see the <b>ps</b> command or the Mac activity
monoitor.)
Now run ethereal with the name of the file to which tcpdump serialized the
packets
<pre>
ethereal r_packets.tcp
</pre>
And then you will get a window that looks something like
<img src="ethereal.png"/>
You  navigate the list at in the top panel to find the HTTP
entry (#64 in our example).
Click on that and the details of this TCP interaction are displayed
in the lower panel. Then you can expand the elements by clicking
on the lines that have an arrow on the left.
And then you'll see the details of the header and the body.
